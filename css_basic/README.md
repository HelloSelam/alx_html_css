## 🧱 Layout Strategy

- Layout is structured using **Flexbox**
- `<body>` is a vertical column: `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`
- `<main>` is a horizontal row: `<article>` (2/3 width) and `<aside>` (1/3 width)

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

- Mobile layout is enabled by adding `class="works_on_smartphone"` to the `<body>` tag
- Viewport tag is included to optimize display on smaller screens

---

## 🎨 Styling Theme

- **Dark Tech Theme** with neon accents:
  - Background: `#0f1115`
  - Primary text color: `#00f2ff`
  - Accent color: `#7dffaf`
  - Font: [Josefin Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans) & [Yeseva One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yeseva+One)

## 🖼️ Design Overview

The landing page includes:

- **Hero Section** with a large background image, a call-to-action button, and introductory text  
- **Feature Section** with icons and short descriptions  
- **Product Highlight Section** with promotional stats  
- **Form Section** with input fields and a CTA  
- **Footer** with branding and social media links  

All content is centered within a `max-width` of **1000px**, giving the layout a clean and focused look.

## 📱 Responsiveness

The layout is fully responsive and will automatically switch to the **mobile version** when the screen width is **480px or less**.

## 🧑‍💻 Interactions & Effects

- **Hover/Active States**:
  - All links change to `#FF6565`
  - Buttons decrease in opacity (`opacity: 0.9`)
- **Centered Content**:
  - Max width of `1000px` centered on the page using `margin: 0 auto`

## 🎯 Goals

- Ability to translate Figma designs to functional HTML/CSS  
- Application of responsive design principles  
- Use of semantic HTML elements  
- Basic interactivity and hover effects using pure CSS
